# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in any of our repositories, please report it responsibly.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing the repository maintainers or opening a private security advisory.

## Supported Versions

Please refer to individual repository documentation for information about which versions are currently supported with security updates.

## Security Updates

We take security seriously and will work to address reported vulnerabilities promptly. After a fix is released, we will publish details about the vulnerability and credit the reporter (with their permission).
